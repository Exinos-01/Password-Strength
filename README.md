 Password-Strength Evaluation
 
 ## Objective
The purpose of this task is to understand the key characteristics of strong passwords and evaluate their strength using online password-checking tools. The exercise emphasizes the importance of complexity, unpredictability, and best practices in password creation to mitigate common cyberattacks.

## Tools Used
- [PasswordMeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com)
- [Security.org Password Checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

## Methodology
Multiple passwords were created using varying lengths and character combinations. Each password was tested using password strength tools to assess its resistance to attacks and receive feedback for improvement.

## Password Evaluation Results

| Password               | Strength (%) | Time to Crack    | Tool Feedback                             |
|------------------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `SimplePass123`        | 45%           | 1 days           | Lacks special characters; predictable      |
| `C0mpl3x!Passw0rd#2025`| 100%          | 1 centuries     | Excellent password with high entropy       |
| `short1!`              | 20%           | 2 minutes        | Too short and lacks character diversity    |
| `Happy@Secure#2024`    | 90%           | 5 centuries      | Strong, could be more unpredictable        |
| `iloveyou123`          | 10%           | Instant          | Common phrase; highly guessable            |
| `Hellothere`           | 32%           | Minutes          | Missing numbers and symbols; weak overall  |



## Key Observations
- Passwords with mixed character types and sufficient length are significantly stronger.
- Common or predictable words drastically reduce password strength.
- Password strength tools provide actionable suggestions for improvement.

### Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Systematically attempts every possible combination.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Tries words from a known database of common passwords.

### Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use at least **12â€“16 characters**.
- Include a mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid using dictionary words, names, or personal information.
- Prefer **passphrases** like `Dolphin$Runs!7Miles` which are strong yet memorable.
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** whenever possible.
- Use a **reputable password manager** to store unique, complex passwords for each service.

## Conclusion
This task reinforced the critical role of password strength in cybersecurity. Strong passwords are a primary defense against unauthorized access, and understanding how to build them is essential for both personal and organizational security. Evaluating passwords using reliable tools provided insight into how attackers exploit weak credentials and how simple changes can drastically enhance security.
